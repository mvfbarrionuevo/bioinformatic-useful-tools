# bioinformatic-useful-tools
Over my master degree I have made a bunch of useful scrips that helped me a lot. They are raw material that may be of some help to someone's need.

Most of these scripts call each other to work properly. I always must to remember, that I'm not a professional programmer, then these scripts are simple and certainly they can be improved a lot (please, make yourself comfortable to improve them or point out what could be improved).

In addition, these scripts do not verify if you have the proper python or pymol packages installed. So, please take a look over the script to figure it out first. I was too busy with my chemistry master to create such verifiers. The thing I wanted when I created these scripts was just the data they could give me, I was not thinking (at that time) that eventually these scripts would be used for someone else.

Please, use it if you will, share it if you like it, improve it if you love it. Thanks! :D
